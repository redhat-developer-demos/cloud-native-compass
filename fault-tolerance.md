# Fault Tolerance

The ability of a system to remain running despite failures. In Cloud Native computing, this is paramount to success. Network fragility and a reliance on systems beyond your control, i.e. third party services, require systems design to expect and respond to failures.

Using technologies such as containers, Kubernetes and system-wide monitoring allow you to improve site reliability.
